# Facial_Key_Regions_Detection
OpenCV Cascade Classifier is used to locate the key regions
in human face, namely eyes, nose and mouth. CUDA programming is 
used to reduce the computation time in the face detection pipeline.
Both the sequential and parallel versions of algorithms are 
implementated to compare their relative computation speeds.
The code is written in C++.
